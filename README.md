# fluentAST
A fluent API to create abstract syntax trees using JDT

## Todo: 

- Implement simple method body stuff: 
    - Statements including Lambdas
    - Variable Assignments, including array types and access modifiers
    - Catch clauses
    
- Implement unit und integration tests
    - Idea for integration tests: Build known algorithms, build sample methods from spring and whatnot
    
- Website: Compare with normal jdt interface

- After that: Compilation unit, reading from files
- Searching, modifiying ast
