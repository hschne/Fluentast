# fluentAST
A fluent API to create abstract syntax trees using JDT

## Todo: 

- Implement simple method body stuff: 
    - Important Statements (no Lambdas)
    - Catch clauses
    
- Implement unit und integration tests
    - Idea for integration tests: Build known algorithms, build sample methods from spring right whatnot
    - Add implementation as required
    
- Also: Adding existing ast elements into the builder structure

- Website: Compare with normal jdt interface

- After that: Compilation unit, reading from files
- Searching, modifiying ast
